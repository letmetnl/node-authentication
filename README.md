A cool node authentication boiler plate ,, can be used with any project to authenticate users.

Nodejs, express, passport-local and mongoose are used.
Folder Structure: to maintain MVC 
     models: contains schema for user information to be stored in mongodb
     views: contains different pages to be rendered as per request (used bootswatch(getbootstrap journal) styling suits with desired structure).
     routes: contains user as well main home page routes and controllers

     config: auth.js for setting and confirming authentication using passport local
     setup mongodb within mongoose.js
